# Lewis-Game
In this repository you will find games that I have created from tutos or from me. 
Here are some features you will find on the unity Game :
You lose health if you touch ennemis.
You can kill ennemis by jumping over their head.
You can take hearts to heal you only if you are under 100% life.
If you cross a flag and you fall down, you will respawn on the last flag you crossed.
You can double jump pressing 2 times spacebar.
You can dash pressing 2 times your direction. You can dash only once if you are in the air.
You can run pressing left shift.
The door on the left side will bring you to an other level, which is the same as the first one...
